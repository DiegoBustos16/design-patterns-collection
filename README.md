# 🏁 Design Patterns Collection in Java

A curated collection of software design pattern implementations in Java, following the classic *Gang of Four* (GoF) catalog. All examples are consistently modeled around racing and motorsport themes, making the concepts easier to grasp and more engaging to explore.

## 🚗 About This Project

This repository is built as a learning resource, providing clear and concise implementations of design patterns using meaningful real-world analogies drawn from auto racing. The goal is to illustrate the essence of each pattern through relatable examples like race cars, engineers, strategies, pit stops, and control centers.

The codebase is written in **Java 17**, and uses **Spring Boot** only when appropriate, without overcomplicating the core idea of each pattern.

## 📚 Design Pattern Index

Patterns are organized according to their GoF category. Each link leads to a dedicated `README.md` with a short explanation and source code examples.

### 🎨 Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, enhancing flexibility and reuse.

- [Abstract Factory](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/abstractFactory/AbstractFactory.md)  
  
- [Factory Method](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/factory/Factory.md)  
  
- [Prototype](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/prototype/Prototype.md)  
  
- [Singleton](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/singleton/Singleton.md)  
  
---

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns

These patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

- [Decorator](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/decorator/Decorator.md)  
  
- [Facade](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/facade/Facade.md)  
  
- [Proxy](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/proxy/Proxy.md)  
  
---

### 🏃 Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and responsibilities between objects.

- [Command](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/command/Command.md)  
  
- [Memento](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/memento/Memento.md)  
  
- [Observer](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/observer/Observer.md)  
  
- [Strategy](./src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/strategy/Strategy.md)

## 💡 Project Motivation

Design pattern examples often feel abstract, repetitive, or disconnected from real-life scenarios. This project takes a different route: each implementation is grounded in the world of motorsport — a domain rich with roles, systems, and workflows that naturally map to software design concepts.

By maintaining a cohesive and memorable theme across patterns, the project aims to make the learning experience more intuitive and enjoyable.
